## Description

This repo will be used to keep track of problems and topics that I use in each rating to get me to the next.
I will have folders for each rating and inside each are topics and problems that where solved to get to the next rating.


## Goal
Goal of this repository is to leave nothing out of my journey and document every aspect of the improvement of my cpp.


### Weapon of choice: C++

* I will be using C++ to solve problems.
Ranking will be based on Codeforces.
Sites will include:
<br>* Codeforces
<br>* Codechef
<br>* SPOJ
<br>* any other site

Training with LeetCode is like training for a marathon. For an onsite interview or programming competition, one needs to endure minimum 90 minutes to 6 hours of pain, that demand great deal of mental stamina and experience both of which require time to accumulate. With the exception of those naturally talented people who can run a full marathon without any preparation, normal people usually need to dedicate 6 months to 2 years of consistent training to be ready for a race. The preparation usually starts with a mild jogging, then gradually increase distance and speed so that one can run faster and longer. Beginners who never ran marathon have massive anxiety and are completely overwhelmed. But with planning and consistent training, anybody can run marathon including disabled people and 80 years old people.

Same is true with LeetCode. Start with super easy problems to gain some confidence. If even the easiest problem is too difficult in LeetCode, hunt down even easier problems from HackerRank, HackerEarth, GeeksForGeeks(School level), etc. Once having gained some confidence, level up. No pain, no gain. If you're not struggling, you're wasting time other than recovering lost confidence. Attack a little harder problem -- not too hard, not too easy. Through consistent practice, a mental stamina starts to be developed, and brains adjust to the stress and get stronger. One feels less stressed out (Mind adjusts to stress through desensitization). Also, the neurons in the brains start to recognize patterns among problems (binary search, greedy, bfs, dfs, dynamic programming, etc.). At first, brains get fried after 20 minutes of an easy problem, but after some practice, brains can handle a longer session of problem solving.

This is a very gradual process. It's said that it takes at least 2 years to be good at programming competition. These days, a bar is high for passing an interview. So, practice for a certain period of time (ideally minimum 6 months to 2 years or more. Even better, make this stuff a hobby. This should be fun. If not, why are you even doing this?). While very common, it is not very wise to suffer or get depressed from a self-created anxiety by setting up an unreasonable deadline such as "I need to land on a job at a big 4 by next 3 months!". Don't get me wrong. Interviews are a great way to get better as a practice. Just set up a reasonable expectation that it takes (long) time with intense training to be good at this kind of stuff and pass with a flying color.

To a beginner runner, even a 5k or 10k race sounds scary, but to those who finished a full marathon, a 10k race is a joke and a half-marathon is manageable. To one who finished marathons multiple times, the question is no longer "Can I finish?" but rather "How fast can I finish next time?" Same is true with LeetCode. At some point, easy problems become easy, and medium problems become okay. At certain stage, everything becomes a matter of "how fast can I solve it?" rather than "Can I solve it?" because you already solved a similar problem before and you recognize a pattern. To do so, keep struggling, keep pushing, learn a new trick every day. Take a break, eat well, sleep well. And repeat.

Pain and struggle make us stronger, but we don't need to suffer or feel depressed through the preparation and actual competition or interview. There is a pretty popular quote for runners -- "Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional." The same is true with LeetCode - "Struggling is inevitable, but suffering is optional."
